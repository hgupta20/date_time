# date_time
Have your Arduino get the date(mm/dd/yyyy) &amp; time(hh:mm:ss) from the user via the serial monitor in the Arduino Development IDE software
Have your Arduino get the date(mm/dd/yyyy) & time(hh:mm:ss) from the user via the serial
monitor in the Arduino Development IDE software.
* Date includes day, month and year
* Time includes hour, minutes and seconds

You circuit/program should:
* print a prompt on the serial monitor,
* get input of date and time from user via the serial monitor
* include error checking for input that doesn't make sense (hours not in range of 0 to 23,
  minutes not in range 0 to 59, month not range of 1 to 12, etc). 
* Giving error messages to the 16x2 display
* setting the Arduino to contain the (valid) date and time entered by the user.
* display Arduinoâ€™s date and time on the 16x2 display
* keep an accurate (continually updating) date and time shown on 16x2 display
